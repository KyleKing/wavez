# Project guidance for wavez

[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md#starting-a-session) says how a session starts: what to
take from Next, jj for every write, one commit per lane, push only at a
milestone, and a PTY run for any TUI change. This file holds the traps that
are specific to this codebase and not visible from the code.

- One `wavezd` per laptop listens on `<os.UserConfigDir()>/wavez/d.sock`.
  Anything that starts a daemon for a test, demo, or PTY run passes
  `-socket <scratch path>` so it does not take over the socket the daemon in
  daily use owns
- `config.UserDir()` follows `os.UserConfigDir()`, which ignores `XDG_*` on
  macOS and resolves to `~/Library/Application Support`. A test that reads or
  writes user-level state (snippets, links, model settings) sets
  `t.Setenv("HOME", t.TempDir())` first, or it edits the real files
- Evaluating pkl starts a `pkl server` subprocess. Load config once at the
  edge (`cmd/`, `internal/app`) and pass the result in. A loader inside a
  constructor that tests call per case spawns one evaluator per test and
  trips `contextcheck`
- Bubble Tea `Update` paths must terminate on any input. A helper that walks
  paths upward (`filepath.Dir`) has to stop when the parent equals the child,
  because `filepath.Dir(".")` is `"."` and never reaches `/`. That loop hung
  the whole `internal/tui` package once
- TUI golden frames live in `internal/tui/testdata/*.golden`, rendered with
  `Options{NoColor: true}` so the bytes are stable. Regenerate with
  `go test ./internal/tui -update` and read the diff frame by frame
- A daemon reopens every log under `.wavez/threads/` when it loads a
  project, so a scratch daemon over this checkout shows the dogfood threads
  without a model. `n` then `Enter` with no prompt adds an idle thread
  without a turn
- The hk steps need mise's tools on PATH. `hk check --all` from a shell
  without `mise activate` aborts on `ls-lint: command not found` and every
  later step reads as aborted; run it as `mise exec -- hk check --all`
- Two laptops push to `main` and a `feat:`/`fix:` push cuts a release, so
  `jj git fetch` and re-read Next before taking a lane and again before
  pushing. One session rebuilt three landed items from a stale base
- On the 24 GB M4 Pro a 16 GB-class model (`qwen3.8:27b`) serves only with
  `-np 1` and a 12k window under the default Metal wired limit (18,186 MiB);
  llama-server's auto slot count and any window from 16k up fail on the
  first request with `kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorOutOfMemory`. The
  machine then sits near 10% free, so nothing else heavy runs beside it
- Harness and pull processes that must outlive a tool call need
  `nohup ... < /dev/null & disown`; a plain `&` inside the call's subshell
  dies with it. `ollama pull` resumes from its partial blob
