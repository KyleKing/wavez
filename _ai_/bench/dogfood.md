# Dogfooding wavez

Runs of `wavez -p` against real tasks in this repo, on qwen3:8b through
llama-server. Kept thin: what changed, and what the numbers argued for.

## 2026-08-16, first runs

| Task | Result | Wall |
|---|---|---|
| Read a file, summarize a type | correct | 32.5 s |
| Create a rule YAML | correct, 3 tool calls | 84 s |
| Insert 3 lines with `str_replace` | wrong, did not compile | 119 s |
| Same edit, thinking off | worse, replaced the anchor | 13.8 s |
| Same edit, thinking off + fixed schema | right placement, still did not compile | 14 s |

Three separable causes, not one.

**Thinking mode was on.** Replying "OK" cost 92 completion tokens, ~89 of them
reasoning. Decode is the bottleneck at ~21 tok/s, so every turn paid for a
reasoning trace nobody read. `--chat-template-kwargs '{"enable_thinking":false}'`
takes the same reply to 3 tokens and the edit task from 119 s to 14 s. The flag
now ships in `internal/runtime`.

**The `str_replace` schema was wrong about its own semantics.** It said
new_string was "text to put in place of old_string" without saying the
replacement is total, so the model deleted the anchor line when asked to insert
before it. Saying so plainly fixed the placement.

**What is left is not model work.** The residual failures were a missing
`path/filepath` import, a missing constant, and indentation. Imports and
formatting are what DESIGN.md assigns to deterministic resolution and to the
format pre-pass, not to the model.

Lesson: measure the harness before blaming the model. Two of the three causes
were ours, and they were worth 8.6x in wall time.

## Model A/B, same edit task

| Model | Decode | Native tool calls | Edit task |
|---|---|---|---|
| qwen3:8b, thinking on | 21.5 tok/s | yes | 119 s, did not compile |
| qwen3:8b, thinking off | 21.5 tok/s | yes | 14 s, right placement |
| qwen2.5-coder:7b | 30.9 tok/s | **no** | 10.5 s, no tool call at all |

qwen2.5-coder is faster and coder-tuned and still unusable here: its GGUF chat
template carries no tool support, so llama.cpp returns `tool_calls: null` and
the model invents `<function name=... />` XML in the content instead. Confirmed
against llama-server directly, so this is the template, not our client. It keeps
the role DESIGN.md already gives it, filling holes for intent edits, where no
tool call is needed.

qwen3:8b with thinking off stays the local default. Nothing in the 16 GB class
beats it for an agentic loop, and the tiers above it are ruled out by disk
before RAM: Devstral Small 2 wants 32 GB, Muse Glimmer is ~20 GB at 4-bit, and
the disk-streaming C engines (kimi-k3-in-c, colibri) need 167 GB to 1.7 TB and
run at 0.05 to 0.1 tok/s, roughly 500x slower than what an agent loop needs.

## ast-grep

A bare Go pattern silently matches nothing: `fmt.Println($$$ARGS)` parses as a
type conversion with an ERROR node, and the scan exits 0 having matched zero
times, which is indistinguishable from a clean pass. Call patterns need the
`context` plus `selector` form. The rule loader should reject the bare form.

## Harness fixes the runs paid for

Each of these was found by watching a real run fail, not by review.

- Thinking left on cost 30x the output tokens on short turns. 8.6x wall time
- `str_replace` never said its replacement was total, so "insert before" deleted
  the anchor line
- A failed anchor echoed a near match as long as `old_string`, so a bad anchor
  returned most of the file and paid for it twice
- `read` rejected `start_line` without `end_line`, which is what the model sends,
  wasting a turn every time
- There was no base system prompt at all. The model got tool schemas and the
  user's words, and nothing saying imports and formatting are automatic or that
  gates decide when it is done

## Where it stands

The model lands the edit when its anchor matches and cannot reliably produce a
verbatim anchor, which is DESIGN.md's measured 2/10 on this model. Every
harness-side cause found so far is fixed, so what is left is the model. The
design's own answers are the next things to test: escalate to hosted after one
failed edit, and move named changes to Modifiers and intents.

## Open

- The model asserted success on code that does not compile, and nothing
  contradicted it. Gates exist but are not wired to change events
- Each `-p` run reuses one thread ID, so history accumulates across unrelated
  invocations
- One streamed token is one event, so a sentence is 30 rows in the log
- Tool inputs are not recorded in the event log, so a failed anchor cannot be
  read back after the fact. That made every str_replace failure harder to
  diagnose than it needed to be
- Hosted escalation is still unexercised, so the router's main claim is unproven
