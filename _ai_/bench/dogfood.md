# Dogfooding wavez

Runs of `wavez -p` against real tasks in this repo, on qwen3:8b through
llama-server. Kept thin: what changed, and what the numbers argued for.

## 2026-08-16, first runs

| Task | Result | Wall |
|---|---|---|
| Read a file, summarize a type | correct | 32.5 s |
| Create a rule YAML | correct, 3 tool calls | 84 s |
| Insert 3 lines with `str_replace` | wrong, did not compile | 119 s |
| Same edit, thinking off | worse, replaced the anchor | 13.8 s |
| Same edit, thinking off + fixed schema | right placement, still did not compile | 14 s |

Three separable causes, not one.

**Thinking mode was on.** Replying "OK" cost 92 completion tokens, ~89 of them
reasoning. Decode is the bottleneck at ~21 tok/s, so every turn paid for a
reasoning trace nobody read. `--chat-template-kwargs '{"enable_thinking":false}'`
takes the same reply to 3 tokens and the edit task from 119 s to 14 s. The flag
now ships in `internal/runtime`.

**The `str_replace` schema was wrong about its own semantics.** It said
new_string was "text to put in place of old_string" without saying the
replacement is total, so the model deleted the anchor line when asked to insert
before it. Saying so plainly fixed the placement.

**What is left is not model work.** The residual failures were a missing
`path/filepath` import, a missing constant, and indentation. Imports and
formatting are what DESIGN.md assigns to deterministic resolution and to the
format pre-pass, not to the model.

Lesson: measure the harness before blaming the model. Two of the three causes
were ours, and they were worth 8.6x in wall time.

## Open

- The model asserted success on code that does not compile, and nothing
  contradicted it. Gates exist but are not wired to change events
- Each `-p` run reuses one thread ID, so history accumulates across unrelated
  invocations
- One streamed token is one event, so a sentence is 30 rows in the log
